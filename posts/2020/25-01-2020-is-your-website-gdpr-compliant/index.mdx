## Chances are, the answer is yes.

Is your business operating in, or with customers who operate out of the EU? If you answered yes, grab a pen and paper and take some notes, this is for you. If you don’t comply with GDPR and you operate in, or with a company operating in the European Union, these tips will help you make sure that you’re still producing the same amount of sales, whilst ensuring you’re compliant with GDPR rules.

The General Data Protection Regulation is a law passed in 2018, centred around what businesses can and cannot do with your data. The law dictates what kind of analytics, trackers and scripts businesses can use to obtain data about their users. You might be familiar with some of the cases of data breaches that were unearthed in the year following GDPR being implemented, there were almost 60,000 in the first eight months. Namely, Google was fined something in the region of £44 million for GDPR breaches. So in short, you need to make sure that your website is GDPR compliant to avoid being stuck with a humungous fine, and I'm going to help.

*Disclaimer: I’m not a lawyer, I do not know GDPR law in its entirety, this is my take, It is not legal information. Businesses should consult their legal team to determine how best to comply with GDPR.*

## Lead capture form

Are you collecting emails with lead capturing forms? If so, you can't just send people promotional offers without the individual explicitly opting in to one of your marketing campaigns. Just because a user opts-in for one product, doesn't mean they're opting in for your whole campaign.

What can you do? Add an opt-in option in your lead capturing form which includes a statement along the lines of: ‘yes, please keep me up to date with your business name news, events and offers.'

Whilst you're there, users need to opt-in to your marketing campaigns, not opt-out, so no pre-ticked boxes on your lead capture forms.

## Cookie consent notice

You're going to need to add a cookie consent notice to your site, keep in consideration that users need to have the option to learn more about what data you are collecting, how you are collecting it, where it is going and why. Luckily, there are some great out-of-the-box solutions for cookie consent notices, such as [Cookie Consent by Osano](https://www.osano.com/). Ask your web developer to drop their script into your site and you're good to go.

## Update your privacy policy

Needless to say, make sure your privacy policy is up to date. This needs to include a more comprehensive explanation of how you collect and store personal data, along with contact information for users to contact about deleting their data, free of charge, upon request.
Secure your website

Do you see that padlock on the left side of your search bar? That means the website you're on is SSL encrypted. These little data files keep your sensitive information encrypted as it travels from your computer to its destination server. This is especially important if your business takes payments. The last thing you want is a customer's credit card details being intercepted, that's bad news and bad business. On the plus side, Google looks kindly upon websites with valid SSL certificates and is more likely to index them higher.

## Are your plugins GDPR compliant?

In 2020, you're more likely to see services like chatbots and live chats on websites. However, this means that you need to be even more vigilant to understand how they are storing your user's data. Are they GDPR compliant? If so, great, just make sure that you link to their privacy policy in yours so that your users can check it out if they need to.

## Is your payment processor GDPR compliant?

They should be, but you can't be too careful. Double-check and link your privacy policy to theirs.

## Are you storing your and deleting your data safely?

A general rule is to store as little as possible in the first place. But that which you do have to store, do it safely, and when the time comes that you have to get rid of it, get rid of it safely and indefinitely.

Now it's up to you to go and check off the items on this list and make sure that you're up to date and GDPR compliant. I've made a GDPR checklist that you can use for reference, you can grab that here
