## You're looking for business success in 2020, and I'm going to help.

Whether you're an entrepreneurial veteran, a freelancer or a start-up, putting yourself out there and showing your brand to the world can be an anxiety-provoking experience. However, in 2020 the only tried and tested way of boosting your business's growth is by getting online, so just remember - the first time is always the hardest, it gets easier.

However, the truth of the matter is that if you want 2020 to be the year of the booming business, then you HAVE to start building your online presence, like, yesterday. I know - it seems daunting and truthfully, it's no easy task. But with some effort on your end and a fair bit on mine, I'm going to support you in getting people excited about your business. So, let's get started...

## Content is king

'Content is king'. If I had a pound for every time that someone had said this to me... You know the rest. But the annoying truth is, that this term couldn't be more right.

If leveraged in the right places on the right people at the right time, your content can be a premium source of recurring lead-generation. Why? It can be repurposed and repromoted in countless ways, but one thing will always stay the same - it's going to take your readers on a journey ending in exactly the place you want them to be, at the top of your sales funnel. However, there does seem to be a determining factor on whether a consumer's last stop is at the top of your funnel, and that's content quality.

High-quality content has the power to turn leads into conversions, it shows consumers that you're an expert in your field, it provides them with value that they can't find anywhere else. When creating content its important to remember that once it's out, it's out. So make every blog post your most informative to date, make every Instagram post the most beautiful you've ever made. This content is going to be associated with your brand forever, so be proud of it.

Lastly, give your audience a seat at the table. What sort of content do they want to see? How can you best serve them? What will provide them with the most value?

You're probably wondering where you'll even begin to find all of this information (and you'll kick yourself when you get the answer)...

You ask them.

Utilise your social media channels. Ask your customers face-to-face. Failing that, explore your insights and statistics. Find out what's working for you and focus on it.

## Develop Your Platforms

Have you got your business's social media accounts set up? If you answered no, do it NOW (okay, maybe once you've read this blog. There's still lots to learn here).

Here are some tips on where to start:

Start with a username your potential customers are likely to remember. Get an eye-catching logo for your audience to relate to your name. Research the most important keywords someone looking for your business is likely to use, and craft a business description based around them. Include a link back to your website (bonus points if you have a way of tracking click-through rate).

Don't have a website? Get one. One of the most important platforms you can leverage in 2020 is your blog and your website. The fact is that business's are 51% more likely to grow with a website and 67% of consumers look online before making a purchase, if you're not there, you're not competing. People buy from brands because they feel safe, familiar and comfortable. Use your website to tell your audience about your business in a way that only you can, tell your brand's story in your own words.

You're already online and social? Great. It's time to make your digital platforms do the work for you. How? By turning them into selling machines. In 2020, marketing gurus are sneakily combining content, strategic design and calls to action (CTAs), like free trials and information packs, to take users on a journey, and the last stop? The end of your sales funnel. Which brings us onto our next point, making sure that you're focusing your efforts in the right places.

## Focus your efforts in the right places

Are you more likely to find your target audience on Facebook? Instagram? Or even Youtube? There's an exhaustive list of places that your crowd might be hanging out, and it's your job to find it. There are a few imperfect strategies that you can use, but largely it just involves a lot of screen hours, a lot of questions asked and some good old-fashioned surveying.

What should you do when you've found them? Double down in that area. No matter where you need to be it's going to involve creating a community of likeminded people who find value in the content you provide. See how this is all tying together?

## Invest in your marketing strategy

A general rule of thumb is that 7-10% of your sales revenue should be reinvested back into marketing your business. Depending on the nature of your business and where your leads come from, where that money is being invested is going to look completely different. For short-term, fast turnarounds on lead generation, paid ads may be a great idea. Playing the long game? Maybe invest in SEO services. There's never a bad time to modernise your existing website too, design trends change like the wind. Don't let yourself get left behind.

## Consistency is key

People thrive on consistency, and as such, it's a key player in your marketing efforts. Your audience needs to recognise your brand and its message, so the type of content that you put out, and even when you put it out should be consistent, week-in week-out. What does that involve? Here are a few things you can consider: Keep a consistent, but demographically relevant tone of voice on all of your platforms. Choose your brand colours, and run with it. Your website, logo, content images should all be in harmony. Create a posting schedule and stick to it, a tool like Later.com should help.
