## 5 Actionable Tips To Help You Get The Most Out Of Your Business Website in 2020
---

In 2020, getting potential customers onto your website is becoming increasingly complex with businesses frequently finding new and creative ways to market themselves. One step you can take to ensure your relevance is having a high-quality website to help increase your sales and stay ahead of your competition. However, a great website is only the first step. Simply having a website isn’t going to help you pull leads out of thin air, or double your conversions in a day.

That’s why I’ve put together these 5 techniques that you can use to ensure that you’re getting the most out of your website and start turning your viewers into leads, and leads into customers.

## Create a Consistent Brand Image
There are hundreds of brands that provide the same services, make your brand the one that stands out. As you’re crafting a more prominent presence in your niche, creating a consistent brand can help customers distinguish you from the rest and build your brand. Here’s how you can get started:

 * Choose a font that reflects your brand identity, modern and sleek? Or traditional and sophisticated?
 * Select a colour palette that you love and run with it. If you feel like getting technical you can check out some basic colour psychology [here](https://www.verywellmind.com/color-psychology-2795824) to see what feelings your colour choice might convey to a user.
 * Create a logo and make sure it looks great in black and white too, to offset it against light/dark colours when necessary.

With consumer culture shifting their focus from brick-and-mortar stores to web-based purchasing, people resonate with brands now more than ever. Trust has become essential in the relationship between a brand and its customers, brand consistency is a key element in building that trust.

## Make it Mobile Friendly

Now more than ever, mobile-friendly sites are crucial in maximising your efforts to increase traffic to your website. In July 2019, Google shook the ground for some older websites by implementing mobile-first indexing, meaning they are predominantly using the content on a website’s mobile version to index and rank the site accordingly. Essentially, if your website doesn’t provide an experience that’s just as good as your desktop experience, Google is going to push you down their search engine rankings and give favour to a website which does. This means your website needs to fill certain criteria:

* Responsive (Your site's UI adjusts based on the screen it’s being viewed on).
* If not responsive, your website needs to have a mobile-friendly version.
* Your mobile site should contain the same content as your desktop site.

This makes sense, considering that in 2017 50.3% of internet searches were completed on some sort of mobile device, compared to 0.7% in 2009. With 5G internet just around the corner, there is a pretty good chance your mobile data provider is going to be offering a faster connection than you get in your own home, so you can put your money on this number continuing to rise over the coming years.

Google even provides a fantastic tool which gives you a break down of how mobile-friendly your website is, you can grab that [here](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) .
## Create Good Quality Content That Converts

*“On average, 5x as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you’ve written your headline, you’ve spent eighty cents out of your dollar.”*

Your content needs to be persuasive enough that it converts your viewers into leads, and your leads into buying customers. This all starts with crafting an enticing title, in some instances your title can be the first, and only impression that you get to leave with a viewer, so you need to make it count.

Great headlines:

* Should contain an irresistible promise to provide the reader with value that they are only going to receive if they click through.
* Use carefully placed power words, such as “awesome”, “unbelievable”, “proven” to make a truly magnetic headline.
* A suitable character length, it should be scannable and easy-to-digest.

CoSchedule have a great tool that you can use to test the quality of your headlines, you can check that out [here](https://www.coschedule.com/headline-analyzer).

Your content should address your audience's pain points, so this could involve some research. Conduct some keyword research to establish what terms they are searching for and generate topics and content around these search terms. Most importantly, provide value! Your content should be useful, actionable, engaging; give your audience a reason to remember you!
Optimise Your Website For Search Engines
Search engine optimisation (SEO) can be tricky, if you don’t have the time to do it yourself, there are plenty of SEO consultants, marketers and web designers/ developers out there who can help you out. But, if your wallet is looking a bit on the slim side, you can use a few of these DIY SEO techniques to improve your rankings on Google:

* Produce content regularly, and keep it up to date.
* Do your [keyword research](https://www.moz.com/explorer), well placed keywords in your content can make a huge difference.
* Research your competitors, they’re your competition! Their keywords are probably pretty similar to your keywords.
* Make sure all links on your website are intact, broken links alone can be an SEO-killer.
* Check the speed of your website using a tool like [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) to get some actionable tips on how to speed your website up to help you shoot up the rankings.

## Install an Analytics Script
[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) is an extremely powerful tool to have in your toolbox. More importantly, its free! Analytics tools allow you to gather important information about your website, such as its bounce rate, or how many people leave your website after visiting only one page. It is crucial to understand what is turning a potential customer away from your page and to treat it accordingly.

Google Analytics also shows the characteristics of your audience such as age, gender, their location and even what device they’re visiting on. This is fantastic for helping you to formulate marketing strategies based on their interests, age bracket and physical location. Finally, you will be able to uncover which of your social media platforms is converting the most so you know where to direct the majority of your marketing budget.

To summarise, google analytics lets you understand how to attract more users to your website, and how your users are interacting with your website. In essence, this can help you to increase conversions by having a more direct, specified marketing strategy.

The tips I mentioned may not be everything you need to know about optimising your website, but even if you only try out a few of them, you'll be miles ahead of your competitors!
