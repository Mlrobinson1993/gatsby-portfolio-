## Are you sick of spending so much money on marketing? If so, this one is for you.

There is a pretty length debate to be had about whether a database-driven system such as [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.com/) or a static HTML, CSS and Javascript website will be better for your business in 2020. Wordpress still powers over 30% of the web, but whilst static site generators are on the rise, they both essentially produce the same result: HTML.

On one hand, Wordpress dynamically renders your website by executing PHP code and querying a database to retrieve your content. On the other, you, your tech-savvy friend or your web developer writes out your HTML and content, then deploys them to the web. However, whilst both options are capable of getting your website online for free, one of these options allows you a tremendous amount of freedom without being tied into a yearly subscription service: **a static site generator*.

The main reason for the sudden spike in popularity for static site generators such as Netlify is the cost, which is free by the way. By migrating over to one of these services you’re also more likely to enjoy better page-speed, security and even simplicity. After all, you’ll never have to worry about a security breach caused by a third-party plugin or a known exploit. You don’t even need to worry about regular plugin updates, saving you even more money and time on website maintenance.

Don’t start packing up your Wordpress site yet though, whether you’ll want to migrate over is completely context specific:

* Do you enjoy the freedom of being able to make design changes on your own website without involving code?
* Do you prefer the ease of your current database for handling email subscribers and memberships?

If yes to any of the above, maybe WordPress is the better option for you. Whilst static site generators are fantastic for getting your website up and running with minimal effort in little time, WordPress is by far superior for handling complex systems for DIYers with less technical knowledge.

However, If you would prefer the increased security, peace of mind and reduced cost that a static site generator will provide, then there are few great alternatives. I’ve outlined three of the main contenders for you below, as well as some of the features which make them so appealing.

## Netlify:

[Netlify](http://www.netlify.com/), who claim to be all you need for building fast, modern websites, have helped over 500,000 businesses to deploy their websites. Best of all, Netlify can have your site up and running in 30 seconds. With numbers like that it’s hard to argue that Netlify is a real contender for the number 1 spot for not only free static site hosting, But also paid plans offering single page app hosting and full commercial web app plans too. Also, their soft 100gb bandwidth limit means that even if you tip over your band width limit, your site will still be served.

**Price:** free

**What's included:**

* Supports Custom domains
* Continuous deployment
* ~100gb of storage
* 100gb of bandwidth per month

**Add ons:** Netlify’s free capabilities can be upgraded with individually priced add ons to handle forms submissions, analytics, user authentication and server less functions. all for a pretty reasonable cost.
Github pages

If you’re looking for a free and effortless way to host your static website, [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) might be the one for you. Hosted directly from your Github repository, Github Pages offers continuous deployment just by pushing new changes to your Github repository. Github Pages also offers the ability to start with pre-made themes rather than starting from scratch, which is perfect for getting your site up and running quickly.

**Price:** free

**What’s included:**

* Supports Custom Domains
* Web UI for making changes to your site
* 100gb soft Bandwidth limit
* 1gb site size

**Add ons:** You have to upgrade to a paid plan to make your websites source code private

## Gitlab pages

[Gitlab Pages](https://gitlab.com/explore) performs in a very similar fashion to Github, it allows for hosting of websites contained in a repository hosted on the Gitlab platform. No themes though I’m afraid.

**Price:** free

**Whats included:**

* Supports custom domains
* Unlimited private repository’s
* Default Maximum page size of 100mb
* 10gb site size
* Unlimited bandwidth
* Unlimited pages

**Add ons:** none.
