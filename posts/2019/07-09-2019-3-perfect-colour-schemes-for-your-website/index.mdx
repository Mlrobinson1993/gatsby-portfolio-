I know in my last [blog post](/2019/14-09-2019-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-website-in-2020/) I told you that content is key for bringing users into your website, but what I didn’t tell you is that we’re still missing one key piece of the puzzle. Colour.

People definitely love consuming content, but a fresh, exciting colour palette is vital in intriguing potential readers and bringing them into your website. If you think about it, it’s not rocket science. The more an item stands out, the more likely it is to be noticed. Otherwise known as the [Isolation Effect](https://www.abtasty.com/blog/isolation-effect/), this psychological phenomenon can help you increase customer engagement and even conversions.

Now you know why a fresh colour palette could be the right design choice for your website, let me show you my 3 favourite colour schemes for 2020:

## Puerto Mate

<br/>

2019 was the year of vivid, powerful colours, which means designs were more eye-catching than ever. [Puerto Mate](https://www.puertomate.com/) is a fine example, using an intense, but not overwhelming colour palette to hook readers into an engaging, interactive experience with their website full of custom shapes and dynamic scrolling effects.

### Here's the palette:

<br/>

On occasion, less it not more. Crypton uses a lengthy colour palette showing some vibrant, vivid colours in an attempt to step away from the past trends of 2018. A striking colour palette complements the exciting JavaScript-fuelled animations used in this website for an energetic ride from start-to-finish.

## Nate Denton Designs

<br/>

With a splash of intensity surrounded by neutrality, this website for designer Nate Denton Designs uses an unusual combination of soft tones to bright, punchy pinks. Nate promotes an energising user experience with a simple but elegant design and a variety of scroll, click and hover effects throughout the site.
