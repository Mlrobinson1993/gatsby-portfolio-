## 5 Actionable Tips To Help You Get The Most Out Of Your Business Website in 2020
---

As a career option, web development has exploded in popularity in recent years, so it makes sense that there is an abundance of resources popping up to help dev-to-be’s with their new career goals. So how do we know what makes a good learning resource?

In short, it depends. It’s not going to be the same for everyone, some prefer books, some like to get their hands dirty and learn by building things with a DIYer approach,some like to be guided through concepts with video courses and code-alongs, and given the chance to build on the key concepts they’ve learned. On my journey so far I’ve learnt that context is key. Without context you lack the ability to see where a concept may fit into a real-world application and consequently may not see the value in the information being learned.

So, with that information in mind, here’s my top 5 resources that you can use to get started on your journey today.

## FreeCodeCamp

The open source, non-profit that is FreeCodeCamp is a firm favourite for many self-taught and bootcamp peppers alike, especially for those who prefer to learn by getting stuck in and solving problems.

The FCC guided curriculum utilises coding challenges to teach programming syntax, problem solving skills and logical thinking. This, coupled with the real-world projects that are a prerequisite for obtaining the sought after certifications make FCC an extremely appealing offer for anybody from beginners to those with a little more experience looking to refine their skills.

This course provides a comprehensive guide through basic CSS all the way to more advanced topics such as naming conventions, Flexbox and CSS Grid.

## An Introduction To Git: What It Is, And How To Use It

Version control is a key topic newer developers should be getting familiar with. There’s no doubt that when you enter the job market you’ll be joining a team working alongside multiple other developers, for this reason version control systems like Git are crucial in minimising code conflicts between your team. In this comprehensive blog post, Aditya Sridhar covers the git basics from installing git via the command line to the various Git commands you’re certainly going to need throughout your career.
