						(hereinafter, "us", "we", or{' '}
						<a href='https://mrobinsonwebdev.com'>
							https://mrobinsonwebdev.com
						</a>
						). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting
						personally identifiable information you may provide us through the
						Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to
						explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use
						this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the
						information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to

						Website Visitors Like most website operators, Mrobinsonwebdev
						collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
						browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
						type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of
						each visitor request. Mrobinsonwebdev's purpose in collecting
						non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
						Mrobinsonwebdev's visitors use its website. From time to time,
						Mrobinsonwebdev may release non-personally-identifying information
						in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the
						usage of its website. Mrobinsonwebdev also collects potentially
						personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
						addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on
						<a href='https://mrobinsonwebdev.com'>
							https://mrobinsonwebdev.com
						</a>{' '}
						blog posts. Mrobinsonwebdev only discloses logged in user and
						commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and
						discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
					</P>
					<P>
						Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information Certain visitors to
						Mrobinsonwebdev's websites choose to interact with Mrobinsonwebdev
						in ways that require Mrobinsonwebdev to gather
						personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
						information that Mrobinsonwebdev gathers depends on the nature of
						the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog
						at{' '}
						<a href='https://mrobinsonwebdev.com'>
							https://mrobinsonwebdev.com
						</a>{' '}
						to provide a username and email address.
					</P>
					<P>
						Security The security of your Personal Information is important to
						us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet,
						or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to
						use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal
						Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
					</P>
					<P>

						sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party
						link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly
						advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of
